# RUBP Protocol Specification v1

**Rachel Unified Binary Protocol** — Cross-platform multiplayer protocol for Rachel card game.

Designed for compatibility with vintage computers (ZX Spectrum, C64, Amiga) as well as modern platforms.

This document is the cross-platform source of truth, reconciled against the
`RachelEngine` reference implementation in `rachel-ios`. When the wire format
and the reference code disagree, the reference code wins and this document is a
bug. See [Changelog](#changelog) for what changed against the original v1.0
draft.

## Design Constraints

- Fixed 64-byte messages (no variable-length parsing)
- Parseable in Z80/6502/68000 assembly with minimal code
- Big-endian byte order (network standard)
- Implementable with <2KB of protocol handling code on 8-bit systems

### Single player everywhere, multiplayer over the network only

Every platform implements the full game locally — rules engine, AI opponents,
and deck management — and needs no network for solo play. Networked multiplayer
is the only multiplayer mode: there is deliberately **no hot-seat / pass-and-play**.
A single shared screen would expose every player's hand, so hidden-hand
integrity requires one device per player, separated by the network.

## RachelSpec Alignment

`RUBP` is the fixed-size binary transport for `RachelSpec`. It does not send the
JSON shapes used by `RachelVMTool`, but it carries the same meanings:

- `HELLO` and `WELCOME` negotiate the selected `specVersion`
- `PLAY_CARD` is the wire form of the RachelSpec action `{ "type": "play", ... }`
- `DRAW_CARD` is the wire form of the RachelSpec action `{ "type": "draw" }`
- `GAME_STATE` is the wire form of `PublicStateSummary`
- `HAND_SYNC` is the wire form of `PrivateHandSnapshot`
- `SYNC_REQUEST` carries the client's last authoritative `turnNumber`, `specVersion`, and optional `stateHash`
- `TURN_START`, `TURN_END`, and `PLAYER_WON` are public transition checkpoints derived from authoritative engine transitions
- `StateHash` fields always mean the rules-only RachelSpec state hash, excluding host-only metadata such as names and UUIDs

Where this document names stable identifiers such as `not_your_turn` or
`invalid_play`, those identifiers match the external contract used by
`RachelVMTool` and the checked-in VM fixtures.

Recovery semantics are frozen separately in:

- [specs/rachel-handshake-v1.md](specs/rachel-handshake-v1.md)
- [specs/rachel-sync-v1.md](specs/rachel-sync-v1.md)
- [specs/rachel-transitions-v1.md](specs/rachel-transitions-v1.md)

To prove an implementation against the reference, validate it with the golden
wire vectors in [specs/rubp-conformance-v1.md](specs/rubp-conformance-v1.md).

## Message Format

Every RUBP message is exactly 64 bytes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADER (16 bytes)                                              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PAYLOAD (48 bytes)                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Header Structure (16 bytes)

## Card Encoding

A card is encoded in a single byte:

```
Bits 7-6: Suit (00=Hearts, 01=Diamonds, 10=Clubs, 11=Spades)
Bits 5-0: Rank (2-10, 11=Jack, 12=Queen, 13=King, 14=Ace)

Special values:
0x00: No card / empty slot
0xFF: Unknown card (e.g. an opponent's concealed hand)
0xFE: Joker (reserved for the Ultimate variant)
```

For suit nominations and matching (e.g. the `NominatedSuit` fields), suits use
the same two-bit ordering as the card encoding, widened to a byte:

```
0x00: Hearts   0x01: Diamonds   0x02: Clubs   0x03: Spades   0xFF: No nomination
```

### Examples

| Card | Binary | Hex |
|------|--------|-----|
| 2♥ | 00_000010 | 0x02 |
| A♥ | 00_001110 | 0x0E |
| K♦ | 01_001101 | 0x4D |
| J♣ | 10_001011 | 0x8B |
| Q♠ | 11_001100 | 0xCC |

### Decoding (Z80 Assembly)

```z80
; Input: A = encoded card
; Output: B = suit (0-3), C = rank (2-14)
decode_card:
    ld c, a
    and 0x3F        ; Mask rank bits
    ld c, a         ; C = rank
    ld a, b
    srl a
    srl a
    srl a
    srl a
    srl a
    srl a           ; A = suit (top 2 bits shifted down)
    ld b, a         ; B = suit
    ret
```

### Decoding (6502 Assembly)

```asm
; Input: A = encoded card
; Output: card_suit = suit (0-3), card_rank = rank (2-14)
decode_card:
    pha
    and #$3F        ; Mask rank bits
    sta card_rank
    pla
    lsr             ; Shift suit bits down
    lsr
    lsr
    lsr
    lsr
    lsr
    sta card_suit
    rts
```

## Payload Definitions

### HELLO (0x01) — Client → Host

```
Offset  Size  Field           Description
0       16    PlayerName      ASCII name, null-padded
16      2     PlatformID      Client platform (see below)
18      2     SpecVersion     RachelSpec version supported by client
20      8     ReconnectToken  Stable token for reclaiming a slot (0 = none)
28      20    Reserved        Zero-filled
```

The HELLO header `GameID` is `0` for a fresh join and the active game ID when reclaiming a disconnected slot.

Current canonical platform IDs implemented in this repo include. The shared
source of truth in code is `RUBPPlatformID` inside `RachelEngine`.

Important: inclusion in this registry means the protocol can identify the
machine class. It does **not** mean a supported client exists. The current
commitment policy lives in `docs/specs/rachel-target-tiers-v1.md`.

The intended policy is open protocol, narrow official support: machines that
can honestly implement the handshake, sync, and action contract should be able
to connect, even when the project is not promising a maintained native client.

- 0x0001: Apple II
- 0x0002: Commodore 64
- 0x0003: ZX Spectrum
- 0x0005: Amiga

- 0x0031: iOS
- 0x0032: Android
- 0x0033: Windows
- 0x0034: macOS
- 0x0035: Linux

The modern IDs above are the canonical ones to use for current and future
native clients. The earlier `0x0010`-style modern IDs are not used by the
current implementation.

#### Full platform registry

The table below is the cross-platform registry of identifiable machine
classes. The implemented subset is whatever `RUBPPlatformID` in `RachelEngine`
currently defines (40 cases at the time of writing); the remaining IDs are
reserved so any client can announce itself honestly without colliding.

`StateHash` is the deterministic RachelSpec hash of the rules state only.
It excludes host metadata like display names and UUIDs, so it can be compared across native implementations.

The extended summary fields are public-only state. They intentionally do not expose hands or deck order.

For authoritative recovery, `GAME_STATE` must pair with `HAND_SYNC` from the
same host rules state. `specVersion`, `turnNumber`, and `stateHash` must match
between the two messages.

### TURN_START (0x08) — Host → Clients

### PLAYER_WON (0x0A) — Host → Clients

Explicit game-over notification.

```
Offset  Size  Field             Description
0       1     WinnerIndex       Sole surviving player, i.e. the LOSER - see "WinnerIndex is a misnomer"
1       4     TurnNumber        Final turn number (big-endian)
5       2     SpecVersion       RachelSpec version for this state

24      8     AttackTaken       Per-seat attack severity received, seats 0-7 (Flags bit 1)
32      16    Reserved          Zero-filled
```

#### AttackTotals (Flags bit 1, additive)

Summed attack severity per seat across the whole game, using RachelSpec
attack severities: a 2 counts 2, a Black Jack 5, a 7 (skip) 1. `AttackDealt`
credits the attacker's seat; `AttackTaken` debits the seat the attack
resolved against. Each byte saturates at 255. Seats beyond the game's player
count are zero.

The wire carries raw totals only - award naming ("nastiest player" and the
like), tie-breaking, and presentation are client-side concerns. Hosts MAY
omit the totals (Flags bit 1 unset, bytes 16-31 zero); decoders MUST ignore
bytes 16-31 when the flag is unset. This is a flag-gated addition in
previously reserved bytes, same mechanism as StateHash: existing encoders,
golden vectors, and vintage decoders that ignore reserved bytes are
unaffected.

#### WinnerIndex is a misnomer: it names the survivor, who LOSES

Every `WinnerIndex` field in this protocol (GAME_STATE offset 16, TURN_END
offset 15, PLAYER_WON offset 0) carries the index of the **sole player still
holding cards** when the game ends. Under GAME_RULES.md that player finishes
**last**: Rachel is a shedding race, first out takes 1st place, and "the game
continues until only one player remains - that player finishes last."

The field name is historical and the byte layout is **frozen** - the golden
conformance vectors, rachel-server, and the vintage clients all encode these
bytes as-is, so the semantics are documented rather than changed. Both
reference derivations in the Swift engine make the survivor semantics
explicit: `GameEngine.winnerIndex(in:)` returns the first player with
`!isOut` (feeding TURN_END and PLAYER_WON via the `gameFinished` transition
event), and `SyncSnapshot.resolvedWinnerIndex` returns the single active
player (feeding GAME_STATE).

**Clients MUST NOT congratulate or credit `WinnerIndex`.** The rules winner -
the player to celebrate, and the one stats should credit - is the first
finisher: `FinishOrder[0]` in GAME_STATE (offset 34), or equivalently the
actor of the TURN_END whose `FinishPosition` is 0. The iOS client originally
celebrated `WinnerIndex` and congratulated the loser on every joined game
(fixed in rachel-ios 4cef442 by deriving the winner from FinishOrder);
treat `WinnerIndex` purely as "the game is over and this seat came last."

### PLAYER_LIST (0x0C) — Host → Clients

Sent to provide lobby player info with platform IDs.

```
Offset  Size  Field         Description
0       1     PlayerCount   Number of players in list
1-48    6*n   PlayerInfo[]  Array of player info (max 8)

PlayerInfo structure (6 bytes):
  Offset  Size  Field       Description
  0       1     PlayerID    Player index (0-7)
  1       2     PlatformID  Platform ID (big-endian)
  3       3     Reserved    Zero-filled
```

### ANNOUNCE (0x0D) — Host → Clients

Flavour text broadcast from server.

```
Offset  Size  Field       Description
0       47    Text        UTF-8 text, null-padded
47      1     Reserved    Zero
```

### PLAYER_NAME (0x0E) — Host → Clients

Sent once per player to communicate names (supports longer names than HELLO).

```
Offset  Size  Field       Description
0       1     PlayerIndex Player index (0-7)
1       47    PlayerName  UTF-8 name, null-padded
```

### HAND_SYNC (0x0F) — Host → Client (Private)

Sent privately to a player with their authoritative current hand.
Useful after optimistic local play, rejected actions, or future reconnect/resync flows.
This is the binary form of `PrivateHandSnapshot`.

```
Offset  Size  Field             Description
0       1     CardCount         Number of cards in authoritative hand
1       32    Cards             Encoded cards in authoritative hand
33      4     TurnNumber        Current turn number (big-endian)
37      2     SpecVersion       RachelSpec version for this hand view
39      1     Flags             Bit 0 = StateHash present
40      8     StateHash         64-bit RachelSpec rules-only state hash
```

`HAND_SYNC` is the private half of the authoritative recovery pair
`GAME_STATE + HAND_SYNC`. It should not be treated as an unrelated sync format.

### SYNC_REQUEST (0x10) — Client → Host

Sent by a client when it wants the host to resend the authoritative public/private sync pair.
Useful if the client detects that its local hand no longer matches the host's public summary.

```
Offset  Size  Field             Description
0       4     TurnNumber        Last turn number seen by the client (big-endian)
4       2     SpecVersion       RachelSpec version assumed by client
6       1     Flags             Bit 0 = ObservedStateHash present
7       8     ObservedStateHash Last authoritative host state hash seen by client
15      33    Reserved          Zero-filled
```

For `RachelSync v1`, a client should populate `SYNC_REQUEST` from the last
authoritative host metadata it has observed:

- `TurnNumber = PublicStateSummary.turnNumber`
- `SpecVersion = PublicStateSummary.specVersion`
- `ObservedStateHash = PublicStateSummary.stateHash` when available

### ERROR (0x0B) — Host → Client

```
Offset  Size  Field         Description
0       1     ErrorCode     See error codes below
1       1     CardCount     Cards involved (if applicable)
2       32    Cards         Rejected cards (if applicable)
34      14    Reserved      Zero-filled
```

**Error Codes:**

| Code | RUBP RejectReason | Stable Wire Identifier | Primary RachelSpec Identifier |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0x01 | NOT_YOUR_TURN | `not_your_turn` | `not_your_turn` |
| 0x02 | INVALID_PLAY | `invalid_play` | `invalid_play` |
| 0x03 | CARDS_NOT_IN_HAND | `card_not_in_hand` | `card_not_in_hand` |
| 0x04 | CANNOT_DRAW | `cannot_draw` | usually `must_play_if_able` in the current host |
| 0x05 | GAME_NOT_STARTED | `game_not_started` | none; host/session state only |
| 0x06 | LOBBY_FULL | `lobby_full` | none; join-time rejection |
| 0x07 | GAME_IN_PROGRESS | `game_in_progress` | none; join-time rejection |
| 0x08 | NAME_TAKEN | `name_taken` | none; join-time rejection |
| 0xFF | UNKNOWN | `unknown` | none |

`ERROR` remains a wire-level reject summary. It is intentionally smaller and
coarser than the full RachelSpec error surface.

Codes 0x06-0x08 answer a HELLO that cannot be seated (no free slot, game
already running with no matching reservation, or the display name is taken by
a different device). CardCount is 0 for these. A joiner receiving one MUST
treat the join attempt as terminal rather than retrying: the condition will
not clear on its own. Hosts that predate these codes simply stayed silent, so
clients MUST still handle a rejection-less timeout.

## Byte Order

All multi-byte integers are **big-endian** (network byte order).

### Converting on Little-Endian Platforms

**Z80 (load big-endian 16-bit):**
```z80
; Load big-endian word from (HL) into DE
load_be16:
    ld d, (hl)      ; High byte first
    inc hl
    ld e, (hl)      ; Low byte second
    ret
```

**6502 (load big-endian 16-bit):**
```asm
; Load big-endian word from 'addr' into A (low) and X (high)
load_be16:
    ldx addr        ; High byte
    lda addr+1      ; Low byte
    rts
```

**68000 (native big-endian):**
No conversion needed.

---

## Transport Layer

### TCP (Recommended for Vintage)

- Port: 19840 (1984 + 0)
- Bonjour/mDNS service type: `_rachel._tcp`
- **TCP framing required** — TCP is a byte stream, use 64-byte message boundaries
- Unencrypted (TLS not viable for vintage hardware)
- IPv4 preferred (vintage WiFi bridges often IPv4-only)

#### TCP Connection Handshake

After TCP connect, both parties exchange transport-level HELLO messages before game traffic:

```
Client → Host:  HELLO (type 0x01) with display name in payload bytes 0-15
Host → Client:  HELLO (type 0x01) with display name in payload bytes 0-15
                (connection established, game-layer messages can flow)
```

If HELLO is not received within 5 seconds, the connection is closed.

Once the TCP transport is established, the normal game-layer initial sync still begins with the client sending a HELLO to claim or reclaim a player slot.

#### Display Name Requirements

Display names in HELLO messages are sanitized for vintage computer compatibility:
- ASCII printable characters only (32-126)
- Maximum 15 characters (null-padded in the HELLO payload)
- Emoji and extended Unicode stripped at the protocol boundary
- UI may show fuller names locally; `PLAYER_NAME` messages carry richer display names after join

### Local Network Discovery

Hosts advertise via mDNS:
```
Service Type: _rachel._tcp
Service Name: <user-chosen game name>
Port: 19840
```

ESP8266/ESP32 WiFi bridges support mDNS, enabling vintage machine discovery.

### MultipeerConnectivity (iOS/macOS)

Same 64-byte messages sent via MC framework.

### GameKit (Apple Platforms)

Same 64-byte messages sent via GKMatch.

---

## State Synchronisation

### Initial Sync

1. Transport becomes ready
2. Client sends HELLO with player name, spec version, and reconnect token
3. Host assigns or reclaims a slot based on HELLO
4. Host sends WELCOME (includes GameID and current game state)
5. Host sends PLAYER_NAME for each player
6. If this is a fresh lobby join, normal game start later sends GAME_START and HAND_SYNC
7. If this is a reconnect into an active or finished game, host immediately sends GAME_STATE and HAND_SYNC

Fresh join before game start:
- WELCOME
- PLAYER_NAME x N
- later, at game start: GAME_START + HAND_SYNC + GAME_STATE

Reconnect during or after a game:
- WELCOME
- PLAYER_NAME x N
- GAME_STATE
- HAND_SYNC

### Gameplay Sync

For each action:
1. Player sends PLAY_CARD or DRAW_CARD
2. Host validates action
3. If valid: Host may send CARD_DRAWN to that player (private, draw only)
4. If valid: Host sends HAND_SYNC to that player (private)
5. If valid: Host broadcasts TURN_END / GAME_STATE / TURN_START
6. If invalid: Host sends ERROR and HAND_SYNC to that player

### Explicit Resync

1. Client detects drift, or otherwise wants a fresh authoritative view
2. Client sends SYNC_REQUEST with its last seen turn/hash metadata
3. Host responds to that peer with GAME_STATE and HAND_SYNC

The response pair must come from the same authoritative rules state:

- same `specVersion`
- same `turnNumber`
- same `stateHash`
- `playerCardCounts[playerIndex] == HAND_SYNC.CardCount`

### Deterministic Local Computation

Vintage clients may compute state locally from seed + actions to reduce bandwidth:

1. Host sends random seed in initial sync
2. Clients track all PLAY_CARD/DRAW_CARD broadcasts
3. Clients apply actions locally using identical engine logic
4. GAME_STATE broadcasts serve as checkpoints/verification

**Requires deterministic engine:** Same seed + same actions = same state.

---

## Timing Considerations

At 9600 baud (vintage serial):
- 64 bytes ≈ 67ms transmission time
- Acceptable for turn-based gameplay
- Host should not flood messages; wait for acknowledgment if needed

**Recommended intervals:**
- HEARTBEAT: every 10 seconds
- Turn timeout: 60+ seconds
- Reconnection grace period: 30 seconds

---

## Security Notes

This protocol has minimal security (vintage machines cannot handle crypto).

**Mitigations:**
1. Host validates all actions
2. Private data (hands) sent only to owning player
3. Sequence numbers detect replay/reorder
4. For trusted networks only (local/family play)

**Do not use for money games.**

## Changelog

### Reconciled against the `rachel-ios` reference

This revision brings the cross-platform spec back in line with the
`RachelEngine` reference implementation, which had moved ahead of the original
v1.0 draft. Client authors targeting the old draft should note:

**Breaking — message types 0x0C and 0x0D were reassigned.** The early draft
listed `0x0C = CHAT` and `0x0D = RAGE_QUIT`. Neither was implemented. The
reference now uses that range for lobby and presence messages:

| Type | Old draft | Now (reference) |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| 0x0C | CHAT | **PLAYER_LIST** — lobby player info |
| 0x0D | RAGE_QUIT | **ANNOUNCE** — flavour text / broadcast |
| 0x0E | (unused) | **PLAYER_NAME** — per-player name |

A client built against the old draft that sent `CHAT`/`RAGE_QUIT` on 0x0C/0x0D
would now be misread as `PLAYER_LIST`/`ANNOUNCE`. There is no compatibility
shim; the reference assignments are authoritative.

**Added since the draft (all additive):**

- `0x0F HAND_SYNC` and `0x10 SYNC_REQUEST` — the authoritative private-hand
  resync pair (`PrivateHandSnapshot` / explicit resync request).
- `HELLO` now carries `SpecVersion` and a `ReconnectToken` for slot reclaim.
- `WELCOME`, `PLAY_CARD`, `DRAW_CARD`, `GAME_STATE`, `TURN_START`, `TURN_END`,
  `PLAYER_WON`, and `HAND_SYNC` carry a `SpecVersion` and an optional rules-only
  `StateHash` (flag-gated) for drift detection.
- `PLAYER_WON` carries optional per-seat `AttackDealt`/`AttackTaken` totals
  (Flags bit 1) in formerly reserved bytes 16-31, so clients can show
  end-of-game attack awards without replicating rules logic.
- `HEARTBEAT` (0x00) gained drop-detection semantics: peers that go silent past
  the timeout are treated as disconnected. The reference iOS client beats every
  ~2s and times out at ~8s on fast transports; vintage clients on slow links
  should use the gentler intervals under [Timing Considerations](#timing-considerations).
- The frozen handshake, sync, and transition contracts under [`specs/`](specs/)
  are the authoritative recovery semantics.

The **single source of truth is the `RachelEngine` code** (`RUBPMessage`,
`RUBPPlatformID`, `RachelSpec`). This document tracks it; the frozen `specs/`
files pin the behaviours that must not change within v1.
